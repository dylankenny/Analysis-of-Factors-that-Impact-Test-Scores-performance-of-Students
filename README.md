## Analysis-of-Factors-that-Impact-Test-Scores-performance-of-Students
# Goal:

Identify and quantify the most influential factors affecting standardized test scores in English and Mathematics at two critical educational stages.

# Dataset:

China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) - longitudinal data on 390 students, with over 70 variables per student, spanning academic, psychological, social, and institutional domains.

# Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Scaling, splitting, and organizing data for analysis.

Imputation:

Diagnosed missingness as MCAR, MAR, or MNAR using correlation heatmaps and percentage missingness.

Applied k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) with Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) or CART, depending on missingness mechanism.

Validated imputation with density plots and cross-validation RMSE.

Modelling:

Compared Elastic Net, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and cross-validation to optimize feature subsets and prevent overfitting.

Visualized and compared model performance and feature importance.

Key Results
Elastic Net provided the best generalization, balancing predictive power and interpretability, with RÂ² up to 0.27 for English in 5th grade.

GBM achieved high training accuracy but suffered from overfitting on small samples.

Feature Importance:

Year 5: Quality of math homework corrections and academic stress were dominant predictors, with surprising cross-subject effects (e.g., attitude toward English predicting math performance).

Year 9: Subject satisfaction and fundamental skills (e.g., geometry sense) became more important, with peer relationships gaining influence.

Imputation:

Advanced imputation reduced RMSE by over 85%, preserving data integrity for modelling.

MNAR variables required special attention; PMM and CART in MICE were most effective.
